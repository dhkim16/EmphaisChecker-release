pew research,https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/04/amid-the-pandemic-a-rising-share-of-older-u-s-adults-are-now-retired/,"The financial context in which older adults are making retirement decisions during the pandemic is markedly different from the Great Recession. During that period – December 2007 to June 2009 – there was a steep decline in the value of financial assets as well as home prices. The resulting loss of wealth induced some older workers to remain in the labor force and postpone retirement. In contrast, household wealth has been rising since the onset of the pandemic. House prices have been rising in most markets. The stock market did have a sharp sell-off in March 2020 but reached new record highs by August 2020.
The retirement uptick among older Americans is important because, until the pandemic arrived, adults ages 55 and older were the only working age population since 2000 to increase their labor force participation. Labor force participation for the entire working age population declined from an annual average of 67% in 2000 to 63% in 2019. This partly reflects a steep drop in participation among 16- to 24-year-olds (66% to 56%) as young people increasingly pursued schooling rather than employment. Participation has also been declining this century among the “prime working age” population, those ages 25 to 54. The overall decline in labor force participation would have been larger if adults 55 and older had not increased their labor force participation (from 32% in 2000 to 40% in 2019).",The pandemic has increased retirement among older adults

firms belonging to an employers’ organization out of the total number of employees

include all employers and not just those in the private sector) and 25 per cent in 2013.4

Mainly owing to the Syrian crisis, according to the United Nations High Commissioner

rural areas (UNHCR 2019). Owing to legislation,15 Syrians cannot be granted ‘refugee’

protection’ status to Syrians. The latest statistics show that 3 587 578 Syrians in Turkey
are registered as having temporary protection status (Figure 15.1).","Figure 15.1 Syrian refugees in the scope of temporary protection by year, Turkey, 2011–20"
